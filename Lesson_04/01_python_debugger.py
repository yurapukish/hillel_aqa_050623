# 1. `import pdb`: This command imports the debugger module.
#
# 2. `pdb.set_trace()` or breakpoint() : This command sets a breakpoint in your code at the line where it is called.
#                                        When the code hits this line, it will stop execution and enter the debugger.
#
# 3. `n(ext)`: This command runs the code until the next line.
#
# 4. `s(tep)`: This command steps into a function or method that is being called on the current line.
#
# 5. `r(eturn)`: This command runs the code until a function returns.
#
# 6. `q(uit)`: This command stops the debugger and exits the program.
#
# 7. `p`: This command prints the value of a variable.
#
# 8. `w(here)`: This command shows you where you are in the code.
#
# 9. `l(list)`: This command shows a few lines of the code around where you are.
#
# 10. `u(p)`: This command moves up the call stack one level.
#
# 11. `d(own)`: This command moves down the call stack one level.
